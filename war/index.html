Please use this site to record information about events on your network and 
in your household for the duration of the Homework technology deployment. 
The site should be used for the following reasons:
<ul>
<li>
To record anything that has happened on your network and associated devices that has 
either been an issue or that has piqued your interest in some way.
</li>
<li>
To record any comments that you wish to make more broadly about your network and 
associated devices over the course of the deployment, such as general trends in 
performance or things that you have noticed have changed.
</li>
<li>
To record, ideally at least once a week, your reflections upon: 
<ul>
<li>how the deployment has been progressing</li> 
<li>how you have been using the network</li>
<li>any changes in your household routine (not just in use of the network)</li>
<li>any household events or circumstances that may have impacted upon your 
  routine or use of the network on certain days</li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 </ul>
This is solely intended as a means of communication between yourselves and the 
research staff working on the project. They will not be published and any extracts taken from 
them will be fully anonymized.
